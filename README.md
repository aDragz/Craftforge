# Minecraft Multiplayer Host

A Windows GUI-based application. Host your own server on your PC easily.

I am creating an app where it is easy to host your own minecraft servers with many "premium" features you would usually pay for. Like backups for your computer.

### Beta?

This is a Beta application, meaning it is not complete. And by a long way. The basics work, but there are many bugs.

### features
* Simple main screen
* Themes
* backups

### planned features
* More default themes, with a marketplace to easily download themes created by users
* plugins download
* easy scheduler, like daily backups, custom commands etc
* More detailed logs

### Multiple consoles?
I have made it so the main screen has a terminal with every instance in it. And tabbed consoles on the sidebar where it is 1 instance. Meaning if it crashes, it stays open. As a readonly console. Good for debugging. You can remove the console by right clicking it, and clicking "Remove Tab". I will make an option to automatically do it.
