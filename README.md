A Windows GUI-based application. Host your server on your PC easily.

I am creating an app where it is easy to host your Minecraft servers with many "premium" features you would usually pay for. Like backups for your computer.

### Beta?

This is a Stable but also a beta application, meaning it is not complete. And by a long way. The basics work, but there are many bugs. But, it is stable to run your Minecraft server today! I am constantly adding features every day. So if you have any ideas, contact me on the discord or through email (go through my website for an updated link / email on the footer)

### Requirements

You need Java to run your Minecraft Server. You can download the Microsoft one at https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-21.0.4-windows-x64.msi or use your own!

### Complete Pages?
So far, here are the more "polished" features I have coded:

#### Main page

### Features
* Simple main screen
* Themes
* backups

### Planned Features
* More default themes, with a marketplace to easily download themes created by users
* plugins download
* easy scheduler, like daily backups, custom commands etc
* More detailed logs

### Multiple Consoles?
I have made it so the main screen has a terminal with every instance in it. And tabbed consoles on the sidebar where it is 1 instance. Meaning if it crashes, it stays open. As a readonly console. Good for debugging. You can remove the console by right clicking it, and clicking "Remove Tab". I will make an option to automatically do it.
